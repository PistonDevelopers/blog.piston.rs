If you want to learn a new programming language, why not make something in Rust?

[/r/rust_gamedev](http://www.reddit.com/r/rust_gamedev/) 

(There are links in the sidebar!)

* We are a friendly community that share code on Github
* You can choose whether to use OpenGL or gfx-rs (a safer alternative).
* Piston provides a game loop, input events,
an image library, a 2D graphics library and 3D camera
* Conrod is a widget framework and can be used in games
* There are bindings for SDL2, GLFW and SFML

There are many other libraries and interesting projects you can borrow code from,
whether it is ambient occlusion in voxel worlds, physics simulation, entity/component system,
path finding or procedural generation.

The ecosystem is in its infancy, but it is rapidly improving.
The Cargo package manager makes it easy to keep up with all the changes.
All you need to type is `cargo update && cargo build`!

Perhaps you will find a project to contribute to?
