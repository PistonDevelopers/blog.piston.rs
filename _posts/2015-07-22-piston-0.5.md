title: Piston 0.5 Released
author: PistonDevelopers

The [Piston](https://github.com/pistondevelopers/piston) core is now 0.5 and includes some breaking changes:

* The `event` crate is merged with the `input` crate
* The `event_loop` is reexported as a module under `piston`

If you are using [Piston-Window](https://github.com/pistondevelopers/piston_window) these changes will not have much effects.

To fix your code, replace `use piston::event::*;` with `use piston::input::*;`.

The motivation for this change is to make it easier to maintain generic libraries
by depending on `pistoncore-input` only.
In many cases you do not need a window abstraction to share code between projects.
Such libraries include controllers, AI and UI.
