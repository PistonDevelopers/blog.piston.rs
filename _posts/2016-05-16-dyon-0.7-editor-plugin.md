title: "Dyon 0.7 - Editor plugin for Atom"
author: PistonDevelopers
---

v0.7 is released! See [PR](https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/dyon/pull/174) for new features.

Also, started [dyon_interactive](https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/dyon/tree/master/interactive),
a library for interactive programming with the Piston game engine.

### What is Dyon?

[Dyon](https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/dyon) is a rusty dynamically typed scripting language

... without a garbage collector, but uses a lifetime checker.

... and has a simple optional type system and a mutability checker.

... and has Go-like coroutines, Javascript-like object model, Rusty lifetimes.

... and got space-insensitive syntax, but no semicolons (except in the ancient For loop).

... and 4D vectors, built-in syntax for HTML colors, and dynamic modules.

... and you can use `return` as variable, mathematical declaration of functions, and mathematical loops like ∑/sum, min, max, sift, ∃/any, ∀/all loops.

... and got some nice syntax for vector algebra.

... and meta parsing, a result of Piston research (more information about this later).

... you know, for game scripting and such!

See [List of features](https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/dyon#list-of-features) for more information.
